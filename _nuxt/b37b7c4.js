If the Client needs childcare services with less than forty-eight (48) hours' notice, the Client will pay an additional last-minute fee of $20.00 if TNC is able to match the Client with a Nanny. Sick Care. If a Client's child should fall ill twenty-four (24) hours before care is to be rendered by a Nanny, TNC must be contacted and the shift must be cancelled. TNC defines a sick child someone with symptoms of a fever of over 101 degrees, vomiting, diarrhea, pink eye, lice or any other extreme symptoms. If a child is exhibiting less severe symptoms such as a cold, runny nose, cough, etc. TNC must still be contact. The individual Nanny will then be able to decide if they are comfortable providing care in the environment. Should the Nanny not be comfortable, the shift will be cancelled and no replacements will be sent. Transportation. Upon request and approval from TNC, along with a signed Transportation Consent form, our Nannies may be able transport Clients' children. If the Nanny uses their car to transport, the Nanny can be reimbursed for all kilometers driven at the current CRA Mileage reimbursement rate. The Client is required to provide the Nanny with proper booster seats, car seats, etc. Transportation will not be provided to children of unregistered clients. Multiple Families. If the Client and one or more other registered families utilize a Nanny at the same time on a non-Black-Out Date, there shall be a charge of an additional $2.00/child for the total number of children up to a maximum of 4 children. On a Black-Out Date, if the Client and one or more other registered families utilize a Nanny at the same time, there shall be a charge of $3.50/child for the total number of children up to a maximum of 4 children. Overnight Care. Overnight care is paid per hour, according to the type of service requested. Overtime fees will apply. Payment. Clients will be billed bi-weekly for services rendered and monthly for all subscriptions. Primary method of payment will be through e-transfer; however, credit card processing is available upon request with an added 3% processing fee. The Client shall keep a credit card number on file with TNC through Stripe and agrees that TNC can charge the credit card, with appropriate fees for any overdue invoices. Late Fee. Clients are required to keep TNC informed of any account changes to their credit card or bank account information. Updates/ Payments that are not given to TNC within 7 days of invoice dates are subject to a $25.00 Late Fee. Overtime Pay. According to Manitoba Labour Standards, overtime is considered working more than 8 hours a day and 40 hours a week. Should a Nanny be considered in overtime, the Client will be charged an overtime rate of 1.5 times the regular rate. Please note that our casual Nannies can work with multiple Clients per week, therefore if the bookings go past the scheduled time, overtime may be charged without notice. Interim Placements.
